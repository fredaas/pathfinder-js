DESCRIPTION

The Pathfinder framework consists of two parts: 1) the visualization layer which
sits on top of the underlying graph-traversal implementation; 2) the
graph-traversal algorithm responsible for maintaining the node grid.

Currently there is only one back-end implementing the A* algorithm.
