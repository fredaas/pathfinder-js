# Pathfinder

The Pathfinder framework consists of two parts: 1) the visualization layer for
empirical evaluation of the underlying graph-traversal implementation; 2) the
graph-traversal algorithm responsible for maintaining the node grid.

Currently there is only one back end implementing the A\* algorithm.

**N.B.: THIS PROJECT IS DISCONTINUED INDEFINITELY.**
